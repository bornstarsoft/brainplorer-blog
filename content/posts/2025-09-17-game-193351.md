The launch of CONCIERGE, a surrealist puzzle thriller from Brazilian developers KODINO Artes, marks a significant moment in indie gaming. Available now on Steam, this game invites players to explore a fractured hotel filled with abstract realities, each presenting unique puzzles and challenges. The standout feature? A $500 bounty for the first player to solve a hidden riddle, reminiscent of classic cryptic games. This innovative approach not only enhances gameplay but also fosters a community of curious minds eager to dive deep into the games mysteries.

Players will find themselves navigating through six distinct rooms, each with its own set of rules and dangers, armed only with an unreliable camcorder. This nonlinear progression allows for a personalized gaming experience, encouraging players to think outside the box and rely on their intuition. As you unravel the layers of this haunting narrative, youll discover that every corner of the hotel holds secrets waiting to be uncovered.

With its blend of horror, introspection, and abstract storytelling, CONCIERGE is not just a game but an experience that challenges players to confront their perceptions. As we step into this eerie world, one must ask: are you ready to face the unknown and unlock the secrets that lie within?

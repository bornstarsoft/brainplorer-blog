In an exciting turn of events for gaming enthusiasts, the long-lost RPG Navinosuke: The Yo-Kai Buster is set to make its debut on the Nintendo Switch in 2026, two decades after its initial development was halted. Originally crafted by a team of developers from the iconic Metal Slug franchise, this game has been described as a "phantom RPG" that combines traditional Japanese folklore with modern gaming elements. The director of Kohachi Studio, Shinano Ishiguro, revealed that the game was completed 20 years ago but never released due to various circumstances.

Navinosuke offers players the chance to explore a vibrant world filled with over 150 yokai, or Japanese monsters, as they embark on a journey across the Japanese archipelago. Interestingly, the game was initially designed to utilize a GPS unit connected to the Game Boy Advance, a concept that predates the popular PokÃ©mon Go by over a decade. However, as development progressed, the GPS feature was scrapped, leading to significant changes in the game's core mechanics. Despite these challenges, the team persevered, modifying the game to ensure it could be enjoyed without GPS functionality.

The revival of Navinosuke not only highlights the enduring passion of its developers but also raises questions about what could have been had the game released in its original form. With an English version confirmed, fans around the world can finally experience this unique blend of nostalgia and innovation. Will Navinosuke pave the way for more forgotten gems to be unearthed in the gaming industry?

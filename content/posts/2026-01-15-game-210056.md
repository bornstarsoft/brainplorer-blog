In a surprising revelation, a player of Monster Hunter Wilds has uncovered that the game runs significantly better on PC when all downloadable content (DLC) is installed. This insight stems from a Reddit users experiments, which suggest that the games performance issues are linked to an aggressive DLC ownership check that hampers frame rates when DLC is absent.

The user, de_Tylmarande, discovered that their own account, which only had the base game, suffered from severe frame rate drops, while their friends account, which included all DLC, experienced smooth gameplay. After conducting tests, they concluded that the more DLC a player owns, the fewer performance checks the game makes, leading to a smoother experience. In fact, they even created a mod that bypassed these checks, resulting in a dramatic increase in frame rates.

This finding raises questions about how game developers manage performance and content checks. If Capcom can address this issue, it could enhance the gaming experience for many players facing similar performance woes. Will we see a patch that optimizes DLC checks in the future? Only time will tell.

Nintendo Switch Online has just made a significant addition to its SNES library, introducing three classic titles, including the first-ever release of the Japanese game Mario & Wario outside of Japan. This expansion not only adds to the nostalgia but also highlights the importance of preserving gaming history for a new generation of players.

Mario & Wario, a puzzle platformer developed by Game Freak before their Pokmon fame, challenges players to guide Mario through 100 levels while he is blinded by Wario's antics. Its unique gameplay, which originally required the Super Famicom Mouse, is now accessible through the Switch's Joy-Cons, making it a thrilling experience for both new and veteran gamers.

Alongside Mario & Wario, fans can also enjoy Bubsy in Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind and Fatal Fury Special, both of which have their own unique charm and gameplay mechanics. As Nintendo continues to revive these classic titles, one can't help but wonder what other hidden gems might be unearthed in the future. Will we see more long-lost games make their way to the West?

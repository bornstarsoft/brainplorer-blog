Netflix is stepping into the gaming arena with a bold new FIFA game, set to launch in time for the 2026 World Cup. This game marks a significant shift as it transitions from EA Sports to Netflix, with Julien Merceron, the former chief technology officer of Konami's Fox Engine, leading the charge. His experience with football games, particularly the acclaimed Pro Evolution Soccer series, positions him perfectly to reimagine the FIFA franchise from the ground up.

Delphi Interactive, the studio behind this ambitious project, is focused on creating a game that resonates with both new players and long-time fans. Merceron emphasizes a return to the core principles that made football games enjoyable, aiming for a balance between accessibility and depth. With the game set to stream directly to televisions and mobile devices serving as controllers, Netflix is redefining how we engage with sports gaming.

As we look forward to this innovative approach to FIFA, one can't help but wonder: will Netflix's entry into gaming change the landscape for sports franchises forever? Stay tuned as we witness this exciting evolution in the world of gaming.

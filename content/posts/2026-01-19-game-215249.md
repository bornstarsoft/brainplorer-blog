Exciting news for gamers! The beloved Far Cry 3 Classic Edition is set to receive a significant update, bringing 60 FPS gameplay to both PS5 and PS5 Pro. This enhancement promises to deliver a smoother and more immersive experience for players revisiting the iconic 2012 title. The announcement was made via the official Ubisoft X account and shared on PlayStation's YouTube channel, generating buzz among the gaming community.

Originally released in November 2012, Far Cry 3 has sold over 10 million copies, cementing its status as a classic. While Xbox Series S and X players have enjoyed 60 FPS gameplay for some time, PS4 owners have expressed disappointment over the lack of similar updates. The update is scheduled for January 21, and for those looking to dive into the action, the game is available as part of the Far Cry Anthology Bundle on the PlayStation Store, currently on sale.

As we look forward to this update, it raises the question: will Ubisoft continue to enhance older titles for modern consoles? Stay tuned for more updates!

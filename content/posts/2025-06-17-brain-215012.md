Amazon Prime Gaming is stepping up its game this June by adding six more titles to its already impressive lineup, including the iconic "Tomb Raider I-III Remastered." This exciting announcement not only enhances the value of an Amazon Prime subscription but also gives gamers the chance to claim and keep these titles forever, even if they decide to cancel their membership later.

Available from June 17 at 9 AM PT, the new additions include a diverse mix of genres and gameplay experiences. From the strategic depths of "Dungeon of the Endless: Definitive Edition" to the nostalgic chaos of "Saints Row II" and "Saints Row IV: Re-Elected," there's something for everyone. The inclusion of classics like "Star Wars: Rebellion" and the charming indie title "TOEM" rounds out this fantastic offering, ensuring that players have plenty to explore.

With these six new games, Amazon Prime Gaming continues to prove itself as a formidable player in the gaming subscription space. As we look ahead, it will be interesting to see how Amazon evolves its gaming offerings and what surprises await us in the future. Are you ready to dive into these new adventures?

The recent revelation from Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke that neither PlayStation nor Xbox was aware of the new Divinity game until The Game Awards is a testament to the studio's commitment to secrecy and surprise in game development. This level of confidentiality not only highlights the excitement surrounding the upcoming title but also raises questions about the dynamics between game developers and platform holders.

Vincke's comments reveal that the statue unveiled at The Game Awards was meant to promote this new entry in the Divinity series, a move that caught even major console manufacturers off guard. As Larian prepares to engage in discussions with these platforms, the anticipation for what the next chapter in the Divinity saga holds is palpable.

With the success of Baldurs Gate 3 still fresh in the minds of gamers, the studio's shift back to the Divinity universe promises to deliver an RPG experience with even greater depth and breadth. What features or innovations do you hope to see in this new title?

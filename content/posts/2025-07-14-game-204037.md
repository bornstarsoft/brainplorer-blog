The gaming landscape is about to get a thrilling addition with the announcement of Sovietborgs, a top-down 16-bit runn gun shooter that transports players to an alternate timeline dominated by the Soviet Empire. Developed by @RetroSumus, known for their work on Xenocider for the Dreamcast, this game invites players to control a squad of three Sovietborgs as they navigate a devastated world filled with monsters and rebel factions. With its nostalgic graphics and gameplay reminiscent of classics like The Chaos Engine and Gauntlet, Sovietborgs promises to be a captivating experience for retro gaming enthusiasts.

What sets Sovietborgs apart is its unique premise: part man, part machine, these elite units of the Red Army are immune to radiation and are on a mission to eliminate any remaining resistance. The games pre-rendered graphics, inspired by titles like Donkey Kong Country, combined with a soundtrack reminiscent of the Red Alert series, create an immersive atmosphere that is sure to resonate with fans of the genre. A crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo aims to bring this ambitious project to life, supporting classic platforms such as Mega Drive, Dreamcast, and Neo Geo.

As we look forward to the potential of Sovietborgs, one cant help but wonder: will this game redefine the retro gaming experience for a new generation? Stay tuned for updates as the crowdfunding campaign unfolds!

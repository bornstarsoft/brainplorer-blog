As the 25th anniversary of Final Fantasy 9 approaches, excitement is building around the rumored remake of this beloved classic. Square Enix has celebrated this milestone with a special anniversary movie that showcases iconic scenes from the original PlayStation RPG, reigniting hopes that a remake is indeed in the works.

Reports have surfaced that a Final Fantasy 9 remake is in active development, following a leak from GeForce Now in 2021 that hinted at several unannounced titles from Square Enix. Although an official announcement is still pending, multiple sources have indicated that this remake could follow a similar trajectory to the ongoing Final Fantasy 7 remake trilogy, suggesting a significant expansion of the original game's narrative and gameplay.

Originally released in 2000, Final Fantasy 9 has remained a fan favorite, thanks in part to its charming characters and engaging story. With Square Enix's track record of successful remakes, the gaming community is eagerly awaiting further news. Will we see the return of Zidane and his friends in a fresh, modernized format? Only time will tell.

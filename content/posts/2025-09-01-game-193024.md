In a significant turn of events, MMO veteran Rich Vogel has confirmed the closure of his studio T-Minus Zero Entertainment, which was recently formed under NetEase Games. This closure highlights the precarious nature of game development funding, especially in a market that is increasingly challenging for new studios. Despite the enthusiasm surrounding their upcoming third-person multiplayer action game, the team was unable to secure the necessary funding due to current market conditions.

Rich Vogel, known for his pivotal roles in developing iconic games like Ultima Online and Star Wars: Galaxies, expressed gratitude for the support from NetEase and his talented team. The closure of T-Minus Zero serves as a stark reminder of the volatility within the gaming industry, where even seasoned developers can face unexpected hurdles. As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, it raises the question: what does the future hold for independent studios in this competitive environment?

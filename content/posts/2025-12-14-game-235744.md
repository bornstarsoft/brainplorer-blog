In a surprising move, Enhance Games has announced that its popular puzzle game, Humanity, will be discontinuing its online services by March 2026. This decision comes after a notable decline in user engagement, particularly concerning the game's unique feature of user-created stages, which allowed players to share and explore custom content.

Despite the vibrant community that generated over 30,000 stages in just two and a half years, the inability to share new creations has already limited the game's online interactions. Currently, players can only access stages they have saved locally, raising questions about the sustainability of such online features in the gaming industry. 

As we look ahead, this raises a critical discussion about the future of online gaming services and community-driven content. Will other games follow suit, or can developers find innovative ways to keep their online ecosystems thriving?

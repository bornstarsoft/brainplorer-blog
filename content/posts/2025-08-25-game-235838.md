A highly anticipated Nintendo Direct presentation is reportedly set for mid-September, and fans are buzzing with excitement. According to sources, including Switch Force and VGC, this event could unveil significant updates, particularly the long-awaited release date for Metroid Prime 4. With a history of September presentations, this year's event is especially notable as it falls just one day before the 40th anniversary of Super Mario Bros.

While the exact details of the presentation remain under wraps, the recent ratings by major boards like the ESRB suggest that Metroid Prime 4 is on the verge of a major announcement. Nintendo's last trailer for the game, released in March, hinted at a release for both the Nintendo Switch and the anticipated Nintendo Switch 2 within this year. As fans eagerly await more news, the excitement surrounding this Nintendo Direct continues to build.

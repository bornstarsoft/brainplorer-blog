NASCAR 25 has officially launched, and it's already making waves in the gaming community with its impressive driver ratings. Among the vast roster of over 170 drivers, only three have achieved a perfect score of 100, showcasing their exceptional skills and performance. This feature not only adds depth to the gaming experience but also highlights the competitive nature of NASCAR racing.

William Byron, the cover star of NASCAR 25, leads the pack as the sole NASCAR Cup Series driver to earn this coveted rating. Joining him are Connor Zilisch from the NASCAR Xfinity Series and Corey Heim from the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series. Interestingly, the ARCA Menards Series makes its debut in this game, with 2025 champion Brenden Queen coming in just shy of perfection at a 99 rating. 

As players dive into the game, the anticipation builds around how these ratings will influence gameplay and online competitions. Will we see these top-rated drivers dominate the virtual tracks? Only time will tell, but one thing is clear: NASCAR 25 is setting a new standard for racing games.

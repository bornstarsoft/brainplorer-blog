Sony's recent patent for an AI-generated "Ghost Player" could revolutionize how players interact with video games, especially when they hit a wall in gameplay. This innovative system allows players to summon an AI version of their character to either demonstrate solutions to challenging puzzles or complete sections of the game entirely. Imagine being stuck on a tricky puzzle in an Uncharted game, only to have Nathan Drake himself guide you through it, or even finish it for you!

While many games already offer hints or difficulty adjustments, Sony's approach stands out by utilizing AI trained on actual gameplay footage, rather than pre-recorded inputs. This could lead to a more personalized and engaging gaming experience, especially for those who struggle with certain challenges. As AI-powered assistants become more prevalent in the gaming world, it raises an intriguing question: how will this technology shape the future of gameplay and player engagement?

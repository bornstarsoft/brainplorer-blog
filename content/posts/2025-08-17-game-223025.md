The Standard Edition of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will reportedly not cost $80, a significant insight for gamers and industry watchers alike. According to reliable insider billbil-kun, the game will be priced at $69.99 in the US, which positions it competitively against upcoming titles like Battlefield 6, also set at the same price point.

This pricing strategy could be a strategic move by Microsoft to attract players who might otherwise lean towards Battlefield 6, especially given the recent success of its Open Beta. With Black Ops 7's release date rumored to be November 14, the gaming community is eager to see how this pricing decision will impact sales and player engagement.

As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see if Microsoft maintains this pricing strategy for future releases or if they will eventually introduce $80 titles as previously suggested. Will this decision influence your choice of games this fall?

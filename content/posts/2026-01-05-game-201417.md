In an impressive display of employee appreciation, Shift Up Corporation has once again set a high bar for workplace generosity by gifting every one of its 300 employees an Apple Watch, Apple AirPods Max, and a bonus of 5 million KRW. This initiative not only celebrates the New Year but also reflects the companys commitment to valuing its workforce, especially after achieving remarkable success with games like Goddess of Victory: Nikke and Stellar Blade.

This isnt the first time Shift Up has surprised its employees with lavish gifts. Just last year, they received iPhone 14s and bonuses, and in previous years, the company has given out PlayStation 5 Pros and even a preloaded credit card worth 10 million KRW to mark significant milestones. Such practices not only boost morale but also enhance employee loyalty and productivity, showcasing how a well-thought-out rewards program can lead to a thriving workplace culture.

As Shift Up continues to grow, with impressive revenue and profit margins, it raises the question: how will other companies respond to this trend of generous employee rewards? Will we see a shift in corporate culture that prioritizes employee satisfaction as a key driver of success?

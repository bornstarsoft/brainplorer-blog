Nintendo has officially announced that Drag x Drive will be launching exclusively for the Nintendo Switch 2 on August 14, 2025, priced at $30 AUD. This innovative game allows players to use the Joy-Con controllers in mouse mode to mimic arm movements, steering a wheelchair in an engaging 3-on-3 basketball format. 

Having had the chance to experience Drag x Drive firsthand at the Nintendo Switch 2 Experience in Melbourne, I was pleasantly surprised by how intuitive the mouse controls felt. The gameplay was far more exhilarating than what the initial reveal video suggested, showcasing the potential for unique gaming experiences on the new console.

As we approach the release date, excitement is building. Will Drag x Drive redefine how we think about sports games on consoles? Let me know your thoughts in the comments below!

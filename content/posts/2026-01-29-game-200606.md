Indie game development team Team Afternoon is set to release their innovative game "Don't You Trust Me?" on February 6, 2026, and it promises to turn traditional gaming narratives on their head. This free-to-play title offers players a chance to step into the shoes of a video editor tasked with crafting a "perfect" victory montage from a series of failed dungeon raids, all set against a nostalgic Windows 98 backdrop.

The core gameplay revolves around precise timeline editing, where players must analyze enemy attack patterns and strategically arrange clips to create an illusion of success. This unique blend of turn-based strategy, puzzle-solving, and simulation not only challenges players' creativity but also invites them to reflect on the nature of heroism and the narratives we construct in gaming. As we look forward to its release, one has to wonder: how will this game reshape our understanding of victory in the gaming world?

Exciting news for gamers: Obsidian's action RPG, Avowed, is set to launch on PlayStation 5 next month, bringing with it a host of new features and content. This release, scheduled for February 17, coincides with the anniversary update that includes a New Game Plus mode, new races, new weapon types, and a Photo Mode, enhancing the overall gameplay experience.

Originally introduced in the Pillars of Eternity franchise, Avowed has made a significant impact since its debut on Xbox and PC. The PS5 version aims to provide a more rounded experience, as noted by Obsidian during the New Game Plus showcase. With its engaging script and satisfying combat mechanics, Avowed has been praised for its detailed environments and immersive storytelling.

As Obsidian continues to expand its portfolio with titles like The Outer Worlds 2 and Grounded 2, the arrival of Avowed on PS5 marks an important step in Microsoft's strategy of making its games accessible across multiple platforms. Will this move attract a new audience to the game, and how will it influence the future of RPGs on console?

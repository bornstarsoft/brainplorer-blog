The upcoming game Silent Hill F was initially envisioned to be set in the real-life location of Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan, which interestingly translates to "Quiet Hill" or "Silent Hill." However, the game's writer, Ryukishi07, soon discovered that the imposing presence of Mount Fuji, located in the same area, would overshadow the eerie atmosphere essential for a Silent Hill experience. This insight reveals the delicate balance game developers must maintain between real-world settings and the immersive environments needed for storytelling.

During an interview at Anime Expo 2025, Ryukishi07 shared how the team explored various locations to capture the right mood. Ultimately, they settled on a fictional town called Ebisugaoka, inspired by Kanayama in Gifu Prefecture. This decision underscores the importance of location in horror games, where the environment can significantly influence the narrative and player experience. 

As Silent Hill F gears up for its release on September 25, fans are left to ponder how this unique setting will shape the game's chilling narrative. Will the new environment successfully evoke the haunting feelings that the series is known for?

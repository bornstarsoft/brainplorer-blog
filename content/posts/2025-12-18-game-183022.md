November 2025 marked a significant downturn in the gaming industry, as hardware sales and physical game spending in the US hit their lowest levels in 30 years. According to Circana, only 1.6 million units of video game hardware were sold, a stark contrast to the 1.4 million sold back in 1995. This decline is compounded by a 27% drop in monthly hardware spending compared to last year, totaling just $695 million, the lowest since 2005.

The surge in average prices, reaching an all-time high of $439 per unit, has likely deterred many potential buyers. Despite the usual boost from Black Friday and holiday shopping, consumers are feeling the pinch. The PlayStation 5 emerged as the best-selling console, while the Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S followed closely behind in sales. However, the overall trend suggests a troubling future for hardware sales in the gaming sector.

As the industry grapples with these challenges, one must wonder: can console manufacturers find a way to lower prices amidst rising component costs, or are we witnessing a fundamental shift in consumer behavior?

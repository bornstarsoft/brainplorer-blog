In a recent interview, Yasumi Matsuno, the returning writer for Final Fantasy Tactics, revealed that the upcoming remaster, The Ivalice Chronicles, will feature significant script adjustments. However, these changes are not influenced by modern societal trends or the current zeitgeist. Instead, the focus is on enhancing the original 1997 PS1 experience while ensuring the dialogue is more suited for the new voice acting format.

Matsuno emphasized that the adjustments aim to make the script more accessible for players, akin to the difference between reading a novel and watching a play. The team has adopted a ‘listening-first’ approach, which allows for a more dynamic presentation of the dialogue. While some lines may be rephrased to reflect Matsuno's evolved writing style, the essence of the original game remains intact.

For fans who prefer the classic experience, The Ivalice Chronicles will also offer a ‘Classic Version’ that combines the original graphics and gameplay with the beloved War of the Lions translation. This dual offering shows a commitment to honoring the legacy of Final Fantasy Tactics while also appealing to new audiences. As we await the release on September 30th, it raises the question: how will these changes resonate with long-time fans of the series?

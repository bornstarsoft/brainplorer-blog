In a surprising turn of events, Amico Entertainment has released several of its games on the Nintendo Switch and Steam, while still holding onto its promise of eventually launching the much-anticipated Amico console. This move comes after a series of delays that have plagued the console since its initial announcement in May 2018. The games, including the stunt jumping title *Evel Knievel* and the platformer *Finnigan Fox*, are now available for $14.99 each, marking a significant step for the company as it navigates its uncertain future.

The release of these titles on popular platforms highlights Amico's commitment to family-friendly gaming, even as it grapples with financial challenges. With the recent transition to Amico Entertainment and the sale of the Intellivision brand to Atari, the company is pivoting towards mobile and PC gaming while keeping the dream of the Amico console alive. The launch of the *Amico Home* app for mobile devices further emphasizes their strategy to reach gamers where they are, despite the console's delayed rollout.

As we look ahead, the gaming community is left wondering: will Amico's bold strategy pay off, and will we finally see the console hit the market? The companyâ€™s dedication to bringing families together through gaming remains a beacon of hope in an industry that thrives on innovation and connection.

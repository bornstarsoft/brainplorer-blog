Recent research indicates that not all brain training games are created equal; in fact, a specific type of training may reduce the risk of dementia by 25%. A long-term study, part of the ACTIVE project, tracked older adults over two decades and found that speed of processing training, particularly when supplemented with booster sessions, demonstrated significant benefits in delaying dementia diagnoses. This could mean more years of independent living for many.

The study involved over 2,000 participants aged 65 and older, who were randomly assigned to various cognitive training programs. While memory and reasoning training showed no significant impact on dementia risk, those who engaged in speed of processing training and completed booster sessions had a markedly lower risk of being diagnosed with Alzheimers disease and related dementias. This finding emphasizes the importance of targeted cognitive training as part of a broader brain health strategy.

As we continue to explore the intersection of technology and health, it raises an important question: could the future of cognitive health hinge on our ability to choose the right brain training methods? Understanding how to effectively engage our brains may be one of the keys to aging gracefully and maintaining independence.

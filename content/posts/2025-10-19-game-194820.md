After two decades of anticipation, retro-gaming enthusiasts can finally rejoice as Incube8 Games announces the long-awaited release of "Infinity" on the Game Boy Color, set for Q4 of 2025. This tactical RPG, originally developed by Affinix Software, promises to deliver a unique strategic battle system and an engaging narrative that has captivated fans since its initial conception.

Originally canceled in 2002 due to market conditions, "Infinity" saw a resurgence in interest with the release of an unfinished ROM in 2016. The successful crowdfunding campaign in 2021 led to the revival of this once-abandoned project, transforming it into a fully realized RPG experience. Players will explore a richly detailed world filled with over 30 areas, five playable characters, and a gripping storyline that pits rival nations against each other amid a backdrop of ancient evil.

With pre-orders now available for standard, digital, and collectors editions, including exclusive merchandise, this release is not just a game; it's a celebration of retro gaming history. As we look forward to its launch, one can't help but wonder how this revival will influence the future of retro game remakes and the gaming community at large.

As we approach The Game Awards 2025, the buzz surrounding potential winners is palpable, especially with the possibility of a surprise Game of the Year. If the voting trends align with aggregated review scores from Metacritic, Supergiant Games' highly anticipated sequel, Hades 2, could emerge as the standout victor. Historically, the highest-rated game on Metacritic has often taken home the coveted Game of the Year award, making this years competition particularly intriguing.

The nominations this year are impressive, with breakout RPG Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 leading the pack with a record 12 nominations, closely followed by Death Stranding 2: On the Beach and Ghost of Yotei, each with eight nods. However, the historical data suggests that the highest-rated game on Metacritic has won the Game of the Year title in six of the last eight years. The last deviation from this trend was in 2019, when Sekiro triumphed over Resident Evil 2, highlighting how unpredictable the awards can be.

As we eagerly await the ceremony, one can't help but wonder: will the critics' favorites align with the voters' choices this year? With so much talent in the running, The Game Awards 2025 promises to be a memorable night for gamers and developers alike.

If youre a fan of indie horror games, now is the perfect time to dive into the eerie world of *Haus Of Irndrous*. Developed by Yxtopia Studios, this atmospheric horror puzzle game is currently available for free on Steam, but only until July 19, 2025. After that, it will transition to a paid model, making this a limited-time opportunity for gamers to add it to their libraries at no cost.

Originally launched in early access in August 2024, *Haus Of Irndrous* was designed as an episodic experience, with its first chapter intended to be free while subsequent episodes would be paid content. However, due to the need for funding future chapters and supporting auxiliary servers, Yxtopia Studios has decided to implement a price tag of $1.99 starting next Saturday. This shift in business model highlights the evolving landscape of indie game development, where financial sustainability often dictates the availability of content.

As you explore the haunting environments and solve intricate puzzles, remember that your feedback is crucial in shaping the future of this game. With updates already rolling out to improve AI and performance, the developers are keen on refining the experience based on player input. Will you take advantage of this opportunity to claim *Haus Of Irndrous* before it becomes a paid title? The clock is ticking!
